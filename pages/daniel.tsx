            It's already been one and a half years since you moved to Canada. 時間真的過太快了... or should I say... <strike>时间真的过太快了</strike>.
            Sorry I keep roasting your Beijing 腔, I'm just jealous you were able to make so many friends so quickly while I'm here dying alone T_T.
            On a side note, I'm really glad that you've picked up an interest in programming, (I know you look up to me as your role model xaxaxa). 
            We will honor the 劉 family! All that said tho, stop playing league, it's bad for your health :) 
            <br/>Merry Christmas!
