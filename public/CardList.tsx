        Thank you so much. I can't thank you enough for the guidance you've
        given me. You have shaped me into a better person by always encouraging
        me to step out of my comfort zone. I remember that summer when you
        brought me to Universal and <em>persuaded</em> me to ride the Hulk
        coaster. I’ve never gone on a looping coaster before that: I was always
        too afraid to try. I still get anxious before riding roller coasters,
        but somehow after that experience, I’ve grown to at least try. I never
        would’ve thought that I would be president of a game development club,
        or have my own website, or join a dance team if you hadn’t taught me how
        to grow out of my shell. My breaks spent with you are always filled with
        uncomfortable, but door-opening memories. Looking forward to creating
        more memories{" "}

        Yo guys! Just wanna spread some holiday gratitude. This year was quite a
        year to join the team, but I'm very glad I did! I've improved so much
        thanks to your help, at least I hope so lol. Joining All Male was quite
        outside of my comfort zone but now I feel much more confident about lots
        of things. It's been such a rewarding journey so far and it's all thanks
        to you guys! Thanks to all of you and for putting up with my noobness
        lmao. Looking forward to comp season!
        <br />
        Merry Christmas!

        . Sorry I keep roasting your Beijing 腔, I'm just jealous you were able
        to make so many friends so quickly while I'm here dying alone T_T. On a
        side note, I'm really glad that you've picked up an interest in
        programming, (I know you look up to me as your role model xaxaxa). We
        will honor the 劉 family! All that said tho, stop playing league, it's
        bad for your health :)

        Thanks for playing so many games with me over this past semester. I
        would be very lonely without you (no homo). It must be very hard for you
        to move over here during COVID, but we got each other (again, no homo).
        I can tell that you've grown a lot (not so sure about your height tho)
        since I last seen you in person. I'm just really grateful to have you
        around, especially during these times. Thanks for the gift, even though
        its region-restricted lol, it made me 非常的感動.
        <br />
        Merry Christmas!

        What a handsome man! I wonder who it is... Anyways, I wanna thank you
        for being like the only person I can talk to at Troy and be completely
        myself... which you already know, is not very pretty lmfao. I'm very
        impressed that you're actively taking coding lessons and expanding your
        skillset - maestro is crying in defeat. Thanks for being by my side; I
        would basically be alone at Troy if you aren't here lol. Looking forward
        to having English and doing Pogcast part 3 with you next semester (we'll
        blast a different K-On opening this time)!

        If you were able to read that japanese stuff up there, you're a weeb
        confirmed x2. I'm really proud that you finished your web development
        course, even if it is 1990s ancient. I can tell that you're willing to
        step out your comfort zone and try new things. I saw your gift for me
        under the Christmas tree but I didn't have one, so this webpage will act

        Wow, four years already flew past. It's pretty crazy how much both of us
        have grown in this short period of time. I'm sure I couldn't have
        reached where I am today without all of your care and patience,
        especially with how 跩 I am all the time. I'm always inspired by how you
        always seek for opportunities and try something new all the time, and I
        wish we both never stop doing that. We're both going to go on our own
        journeys soon, but we'll keep supporting each other for sure.

          trip will remain a core memory for me, and I'm glad I could be my
          weird self with you guys (*frat flicking*). #internz may be filled

I can tell you're the guy everyone confides in, whether it's girl problems or problems that can only be solved in Chinese (woc 😂). I hope we keep playing league and breaking production code :)"

Like you said, I feel like we would've been amazing friends if we met in high school or undergrad, but I'm glad we crossed paths.
